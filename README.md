## The Problem

When you want to generate an image using AI tools like Midjourney or DALL-E, the quality of what you get back depends almost entirely on how well you describe it. Most people don't know how to write a good prompt — they type something vague and get something generic.

## What This Does

VisionPrompt AI takes a simple description from you and turns it into a detailed, structured prompt that actually works well with AI image generators. Think of it as a translator between "what you have in your head" and "what the AI needs to hear."

You log in, type what you're imagining, and get back a ready-to-use prompt you can paste directly into Midjourney, DALL-E, or Stable Diffusion.

## Status

This is an early-stage project built to explore the idea. It works, but there's a lot more I want to add — prompt history, style presets, side-by-side image previews.
